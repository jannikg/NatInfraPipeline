Utilities,Water and Sewerage,Project over £50m,In Construction,Bazalgette Tunnel Ltd (also trading as 'Tideway') . ,Thames Tideway Tunnel,Project,1,"Construction of a new 25km sewer tunnel. Starting in West London, the main tunnel generally follows the route of the River Thames to Limehouse, where it then continues north-east to Abbey Mills Pumping Station near Stratford. There, it will connect to the Lee Tunnel to transfer the sewage to Beckton Sewage Treatment Works. On 4 June 2014, Ministers made a Specification Notice under the Water Industry (Specified Infrastructure Projects) (English Undertakers) Regulations 2013 requiring Thames Water to procure an independent infrastructure provider to finance and construct the Thames Tideway Tunnel, that would deliver environmental improvements to the River Thames and to bring the UK into compliance with the European Directive.
The Secretaries of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and for Communities and Local Government granted development consent for the Tunnel in September 2014.   Ofwat awarded the licence to finance and deliver the Tunnel to Bazalgette Tunnel Ltd (known as Tideway) and the Secretary of State signed a Government Support Package with Bazalgette Tunnel Ltd in August 2015. This concluded the development, planning and procurement phase of the project.  The project has now moved into the construction phase, with tunnelling set to begin in 2018. In August 2017, the project exited the Government's Major Project Programme.

TWUL's financial interests will continue throughout the project following its continued construction programme to integrate the Tideway Tunnel and the existing network (overall £1.019bn capital expenditure, in 2014/15 prices)
Date in Service of 2023 relates to construction of the Tunnel by 2023, with system acceptance by 2027.
